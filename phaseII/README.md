# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

In order to further refine the user experience of our revolutionary application, we have shifted our focus towards obtaining user feedback to help identify potential areas for improvement. This user feedback has been instrumental for us, as we work to optimize the efficiency and satisfaction of navigating the Tee-Together app interface in its current wireframe form.

## Methods

Near the end of Phase 1, the Tee-Together software engineers presented their current progress on the app to their classmates. During this presentation, we provided three questions for the software engineers would solicit informal feedback:

 1. Is there anything visually uncomfortable about the design (does anything look out of place)?
 2. What are some things that have bothered you about other mobile apps that we should take care to avoid?
 3. What are some additional features that you would like to see in the app?



## Findings

The informal feedback obtained by the Tee-Together software engineers was returned to us as a brief, aggregated list of suggestions, rather than as answers to the three questions we provided. This is the feedback verbatim:

> default to 9 or 18 holes on scorecard, option to choose how many holes user play, store scorecard to database, too many notifications, sign in automatically, no ads, unnecessary steps, friend each others accounts (view stats on friends), integrate maps, one player can keep score of many in one scorecard, send scorecard to friends, daily leaderboards, less android-y UI

Here is the feedback again, reworded and reformatted to fit with the provided questions:

 1. Is there anything visually uncomfortable about the design (does anything look out of place)?
   - *The app's aesthetic does not do enough to distinguish itself from default Android app themes.*
 2. What are some things that have bothered you about other mobile apps that we should take care to avoid?
   - *Avoid subjecting users to superfluous tasks, excessive notifications, or advertisements of any form. Users should not be logged out every time the app is closed.* 
 3. What are some additional features that you would like to see in the app?
   - *Allow users to participate in daily leaderboards, view maps of golf courses, view other user profiles, become friends with other users, and send scorecards to friends. When creating the scorecard, include default course length options (ideally, 9 and 18 hole courses), and allow for multiple players on the same scorecard. Scorecards should be stored remotely, allowing users to access their scorecards on multiple devices with a single account*

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

While we are grateful to now have access to some user feedback, it is unlikely that any of it has come from a user within our target demographic. In particular, Software Engineering students are especially subject to bias about an app's usability
