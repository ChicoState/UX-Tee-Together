# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Competitive analysis of three related products revealed Tee-Togetherâ€™s unique advantages:
Globally accessible: Competing apps require course to be in database to score games within app, which limits functionality in poorly-documented regions.
Unconditionally free-to-use: Absolutely no ads or payments required. Competing apps with profit incentives limit free features and follow subscription models when providing full app access.
