## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

Shortly after the conclusion of Phase II, informal feedback was once again drawn from Software Engineering students during a presentation by our software engineers. The participants were asked two questions:
- For those familiar with golf, which scoring system would you rather see in our app - total strokes or strokes from par?
- Would you consider collaborative scorecards (i.e. multiple players filling out the same scorecard simultaneously) to be a feature worth pursuing?

Once a working prototype was produced, we performed a usability test (n=5) with fellow Usability Engineering students acting as participants. To ensure the participants could be considered genuine users of the app, the participants were informally screened in advance of the study, with some golf knowledge and/or experience being required to participate.

Before each usability test began, the moderator read the test's Informed Consent form out loud to the participant, detailing the minimized risks associated with the study. All 5 participants read and signed the form, approving each test to go forward.

[Background information]

Participants were then asked to complete two tasks on both Hole19 and Tee-Together, with the order of the apps being randomized between participants.

Task 1 for each app involved signing on to a premade account and viewing the profile information. This task was set up for comparing the relative ease of creating/signing into an account on each app. Task 2 for each app involved finding information on a course named "Spring Valley", creating a scorecard for that course, and recording a score for the course's first hole. This task was set up to compare the clarity of each app's Courses page and scorecard creation process.

In order to gain quantifiable data on the ease of using each app, participants were asked to rate the ease of a task on a scale from 1-5 (1 being very difficult, 5 being very easy) immediately after completing it.

[Wrap-Up]

## Findings

The informal feedback responses, directly as transcribed by the Tee-Together software engineers, are as follows:

> For those familiar with golf, which scoring system would you rather see in our app - total strokes or strokes from par?
- _Subjective, some prefer total strokes some prefer par. Maybe have both as options to our app?_

> Would you consider collaborative scorecards (i.e. multiple players filling out the same scorecard simultaneously) to be a feature worth pursuing?
- _Yes, it would make it easier to see fellow players scores. Many play per cart, so 1 scorecard kept. Additional functionality for both options, sync phones together._


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

NOTES: (n=5) is the absolute minumum acceptable sample size; Task 1 originally inlcuded profile picture; the actual act of adding a profile picture was struck from Hole19 to avoid potential privacy concerns, but no users were able to find the profile picture setting before giving up; the removal of this part of the task was disclosed to some, but not all, participants, which may have affected the difficulty rating of Task 1; bias from participants being fellow UX students; limited screening, people could just sign up; Hole19 was paywalled, we did not pay for full version.
