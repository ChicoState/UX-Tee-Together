## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

Shortly after the conclusion of Phase II, informal feedback was once again drawn from Software Engineering students during a presentation by our software engineers. The participants were asked two questions:
- For those familiar with golf, which scoring system would you rather see in our app - total strokes or strokes from par?
- Would you consider collaborative scorecards (i.e. multiple players filling out the same scorecard simultaneously) to be a feature worth pursuing?



## Findings

The informal feedback responses, directly as transcribed by the Tee-Together software engineers, are as follows:

> For those familiar with golf, which scoring system would you rather see in our app - total strokes or strokes from par?
- _Subjective, some prefer total strokes some prefer par. Maybe have both as options to our app?_

> Would you consider collaborative scorecards (i.e. multiple players filling out the same scorecard simultaneously) to be a feature worth pursuing?
- _Yes, it would make it easier to see fellow players scores. Many play per cart, so 1 scorecard kept. Additional functionality for both options, sync phones together._

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
