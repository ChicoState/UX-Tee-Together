# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

The game of golf is one steeped in tradition and classical virtues, but has had a tough time translating these aspects to attract the modern era. Tee-Together aims to be the straight-shooter of the modern golf era, providing a social and competitive hub for new and experienced golfers alike. Research into other app experiences revealed opportunities to invigorate our app’s user experience and the game of golf itself.
- Competitive analysis of three related products revealed Tee-Together’s unique advantages:
  - Globally accessible: Competing apps require a course to be in their database to score games within the app, which limits functionality in poorly-documented regions.
  - Unconditionally free-to-use: Absolutely no ads or payments required. Competing apps with profit incentives limit free features and follow subscription models when providing full app access.
  - Full social functionality: Competing apps limit direct user interactions, instead opting for feeds of public content.
- Heuristic evaluation of our most direct competitor found a simple user-friendly design, made complicated by an excess of features and subscription-based paywalling.
