# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
    We were unable to properly evaluate Hole19 on the basis of error prevention/recognition/recovery. This is because we did not encounter any user errors in our time experimenting with Hole19. One potential source of “error” is that a free-tier user can select any of the many premium features they cannot use, which brings up an advertisement for the app’s premium subscription. This interaction is certainly intended by the developers, however, so we strain to call it a user error.
    In addition, besides a few snippets of feedback from software engineer students, we currently have absolutely no user data to work with. Finding this user data may be difficult going forward. Since the app’s target demographic must be invested enough in golf to get an app for it, they may also be experienced enough with golf to prefer—or at least know well enough to ignore—the additional features of Hole19 a completely casual player would not need. We are also novices to the field of UX, so it is possible we have misguided findings and conclusions.
