# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

In order to further refine the user experience of our revolutionary application, we have shifted our focus towards obtaining user feedback to help identify potential areas for improvement. This user feedback has been instrumental for us as we work to increase the efficiency and satisfaction of navigating the Tee-Together app interface in its current wireframe form.

## Methods

Near the end of Phase 1, the Tee-Together software engineers presented their current progress on the app to their classmates. During this presentation, we provided three questions with which the software engineers could solicit informal feedback:

 1. Is there anything visually uncomfortable about the design (does anything look out of place)?
 2. What are some things that have bothered you about other mobile apps that we should take care to avoid?
 3. What are some additional features that you would like to see in the app?

## Findings

The informal feedback obtained by the Tee-Together software engineers was returned to us as a brief, aggregated list of suggestions, rather than as answers to the three questions we provided. This is the feedback verbatim:

> default to 9 or 18 holes on scorecard, option to choose how many holes user play, store scorecard to database, too many notifications, sign in automatically, no ads, unnecessary steps, friend each others accounts (view stats on friends), integrate maps, one player can keep score of many in one scorecard, send scorecard to friends, daily leaderboards, less android-y UI

Here is the feedback again, reworded and reformatted to fit with the provided questions:

 1. Is there anything visually uncomfortable about the design (does anything look out of place)?
> *The app's aesthetic does not do enough to distinguish itself from default Android app themes.*
 2. What are some things that have bothered you about other mobile apps that we should take care to avoid?
> *Avoid subjecting users to superfluous tasks, excessive notifications, or advertisements of any form. Users should not be logged out every time the app is closed.*
 3. What are some additional features that you would like to see in the app?
> *Allow users to participate in daily leaderboards, view maps of golf courses, view other user profiles, become friends with other users, and send scorecards to friends. When creating the scorecard, include default course length options (ideally, 9 and 18 hole courses), and allow for multiple players on the same scorecard. Scorecards should be stored remotely, allowing users to access their scorecards on multiple devices with a single account.*

From the two cognitive walkthroughs we received, it is clear that our first wireframes came close, but did not fully realize the goals defined in the scenario of our persona Daryll Wood. There were complaints about the ambiguity of the “Handle” field in the Create Account section and the “72” icon in the bottom navbar. The users encouraged us to explain these icons somewhere within the app, or rework them to be more recognizable.

The actual flow of the app caused no issues up until the Courses and Scorecard sections. We had considered to these pages to be the goals of Daryll Wood’s scenario. However, the first draft of the wireframe lacks a proper page for when a course is selected or a scorecard is being edited. The users, unsure of where to go after having created a scorecard or selected a course, simply moved on to the next page of the wireframe PDF, which in both cases was not a correct flow through the app and caused confusion.

## Conclusions
The informal feedback provided by the Software Engineering students offered plenty of suggestions for features to be added or avoided, but only provided one broad criticism of the app's visual design: in its current form, the app's visual design is too conventional. In the interest of keeping the user experience simple and efficient, we plan to stay the course and keep the layout conventional for our MVP. Ideally, our app will begin to stand out more as we incorporate the other elements of the visual design not covered by the wireframe. Of the features suggested, most are already planned for the minimum viable product and are simply not included yet. Daily leaderboards and course maps are the two notable exceptions to this, as these are considered to be post-MVP additions. The feedback does not indicate that we are subjecting users to superfluous tasks at any particular point in the app's user experience, nor excessive notifications, nor advertisements.

From the two cognitive walkthroughs we received, it is clear that our first wireframes came close, but did not fully realize the goals defined in the scenario of our persona Daryll Wood. There were complaints about the ambiguity of the “Handle” field in the Create Account section and the “72” icon in the bottom navbar. The users encouraged us to explain these icons somewhere within the app, or rework them to be more recognizable. "Handle" is a term borrowed from other social media sites like X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram, denoting a unique account indentifier starting with the @ symbol (for example, @teetogether). To clarify this, a brief text snippet explaining the purpose of the handle has been placed below the Handle input field in our updated wireframe.

So, as we have learned from our two cognitive walkthroughs, there are a few pages that need to be added. First, we need to add an Edit Scorecard page, so that it is clear how you can update and edit cards. Next we need to add a Course Details page that you can access from interacting with a course. This would help satisfy Darryl Wood’s scenario. We also need to add the Events and Chat pages in order to satisfy the goals in of our other scenarios.

## Caveats

While we are grateful to now have access to some user feedback, it is uncertain (and unlikely) that any of it has come from users within our target demographic.

Regarding the informal feedback, we do not know which software engineers we received feedback from, let alone their level of interest in golf. While we may infer that the Software Engineering students are experienced enough with smartphones to use our app, they may in fact be too experienced to provide meaningful feedback on usability. Due to their extra experience working with smartphone apps, likely with the same platform and foundational code as ours, they may already be familiar with commonly-used poor design conventions that average Tee-Together users would not understand, and mistake their specific understanding of the convention for general recognizability.
