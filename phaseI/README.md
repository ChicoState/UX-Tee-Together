# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods

In order to better understand the market we intend to enter, and identify potential selling points unique to Tee-Together, we compared the features of three other social golf apps (Deemples Golf, Tee Up, and Hole19) via competitive analysis. We also performed a heuristic evaluation of our most established competitor Hole19, in which the app was rated on a scale from 1 to 10 for its adherence to several tenets of UX design. This was done for the purpose of exposing potential design improvements/pitfalls in our competition, as well as putting us in the mindset to evaluate the user experience we are creating for Tee-Together. In order to have a visual reference for our app concept, we sketched the rough layout for multiple possible states of our app. Three personas, each with their own unique goals and scenarios, were also created to establish potential user goals that our app could satisfy. 

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
We were unable to properly evaluate Hole19 on the basis of error prevention/recognition/recovery. This is because we did not encounter any user errors in our time experimenting with Hole19. One potential source of “error” is that a free-tier user can select any of the many premium features they cannot use, which brings up an advertisement for the app’s premium subscription. This interaction is certainly intended by the developers, however, so we strain to call it a user error.
In addition, besides a few snippets of feedback from software engineer students, we currently have absolutely no user data to work with. Finding this user data may be difficult going forward. Since the app’s target demographic must be invested enough in golf to get an app for it, they may also be experienced enough with golf to prefer—or at least know well enough to ignore—the additional features of Hole19 a completely casual player would not need. We are also novices to the field of UX, so it is possible we have misguided findings and conclusions.
