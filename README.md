# Tee-Together

Tee-Together is a work-in-progress golf-scorekeeping app with full social functionality, which allows users to play golf games asynchronously by sharing their scorecards. The app also plans to offer customizable profiles, location-based course listings, and app-wide interactive events.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

The game of golf is one steeped in tradition and classical virtues, but has had a tough time translating these aspects to attract the modern era. Tee-Together aims to be the straight-shooter of the modern golf era, **providing a social and competitive hub for new and experienced golfers alike**. Research into other app experiences revealed opportunities to **invigorate our app’s user experience** and the game of golf itself.
- Competitive analysis of three related products revealed Tee-Together’s **unique advantages**:
  - <ins>Globally accessible</ins>: Competing apps require a course to be in their database to score games within the app, which limits **functionality in poorly-documented regions**.
  - <ins>Unconditionally free-to-use</ins>: Absolutely **no ads or payments required**. Competing apps with profit incentives limit free features and follow subscription models when providing full app access.
  - <ins>Full social functionality</ins>: Competing apps limit **direct user interactions**, instead opting for feeds of public content.
- Heuristic evaluation of our most direct competitor found a simple user-friendly design, made complicated by an **excess of features** and **subscription-based paywalling**.
- Sketches put our initial layout concepts onto paper
  - Radial Navigation Bar helps interface **stand out from competition** (post-MVP addition)
  - Adherence to social media layout and symbol standards **keeps app features recognizable**
- Personas and Scenarios highlighted potential goals of our users, and how these goals may be satisfied
  - **Make course accessibility information readily available** (i.e. carts, on-course water dispensaries)
  - Allow for creation of global (app-wide) and local golf events to **boost user engagement**

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

Since the end of Phase I, plenty of progress has been made towards maximizing the ease and enjoyability of the Tee-Together user experience. External feedback on previous iterations of Tee-Together’s design offered valuable advice for **creating a more satisfying and efficient user experience**.
- <ins>Cognitive walkthroughs</ins> of our wireframe revealed opportunities to **strengthen the continuity of the app’s navigation** and made clear which additional screens will be necessary to **satisfy user goals**.
- <ins>Informal feedback</ins> from Software Engineering students highlighted extra features and options that could be added to help improve the user experience on our app.
- <ins>Wireframes</ins> have been updated to reflect the feedback received and **represent every user interaction** intended for our minimum viable product. 
  - Screens not included in the first wireframe draft, such as those for Events and Scorecard Editing, have been added.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

Progress towards realizing the true, comprehensive Tee-Together user experience continues. Direct user testing and further external feedback has illuminated successes of our app's UX design and possible areas for further **improvement over our competitors**.
- <ins>An informal feedback session</ins>, once again consisting of Software Engineering students, aimed to reveal users' preferences for Tee-Together's scorecard system.
- <ins>A prototype</ins> of Tee-Together, which recreates the intended user interface in high fidelity, has now been created from our previous wireframe, allowing for the simulation of **geniune user interaction**.
- <ins>Within-subject Usability testing</ins> comparing the Tee-Together prototype to top competitor Hole19 demonstrated **significant advantages in Tee-Together's simpler design** over the more cluttered design of Hole19. 
  - Users offered suggestions for how make the Tee-Together interface clearer, as well as additional screens and navigations which may increase user satisfaction.
